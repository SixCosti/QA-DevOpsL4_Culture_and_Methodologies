Day 1 of Activity 1.2 | DevOps Culture and Methodologies: Discover and Practice.
I've had in the class a better overview of what DevOps means and that the cultural approach to software development is about working together and sharing responsibilities. 
It breaks down the barriers between different teams and focuses on making high-quality software. 
DevOps principles help developers and operations teams work better together. 
Automation is a big part of this approach, making things faster and more consistent. 
Continuous integration is like putting puzzle pieces together, and it helps us catch mistakes early. 
Continuous delivery means we can release new features easily after getting approval. 
Continuous deployment takes it a step further by releasing features automatically without needing humans to do it. It's like magic! 
This approach helps us collaborate, make better software, and work more efficiently. 
There were 2 research exercises where I had to work as part of a team, you will find attached the outcome of that.
